# TempLabs – Global GitHub Configuration

This repository contains **organization-wide** GitHub resources for the TempLabs org.

GitHub will automatically use the files in this repository as **defaults** for all repositories in the organization, unless a repository provides its own versions.

## What’s in here?

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` – expected behavior for all contributors
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` – how to file issues, make PRs, and our expectations
- `SECURITY.md` – how to report vulnerabilities privately
- `SUPPORT.md` – where to get help
- `FUNDING.yml` – GitHub Sponsors / funding links
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` – default issue templates
- `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` – default PR checklist
- `profile/README.md` – content shown on the organization profile page

If an individual repository needs *stricter* or *project-specific* rules, it can still add its own `.github/` folder – that will override these defaults.
